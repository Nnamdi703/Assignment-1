            <p>Coming into alt school africa wasn't an easy decision to make , especially for one who isn't coming from any prior computer or coding knowldge. It wasn't an easy decision in sense that am one who loves to be realistic and weigh his options, so at first i didn't see myself as one who would make. so After watching a video of alt schhool alumi on youtube, i decided to take the bold step and see what would come out.</p>
